# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue, please avoid opening a public issue first.

Use GitHub Security Advisories for private reporting when possible:

- https://github.com/ayutaz/uStyle-Bert-VITS2/security/advisories

If advisories are unavailable in your environment, open an issue and clearly mark it as security-related while minimizing sensitive details.

## Scope

Security reports are primarily relevant to:

- Native interop boundaries (P/Invoke, DLL loading)
- External model/dictionary ingestion paths
- Dependency and supply-chain issues

## Supported Versions

The `main` branch is the actively supported line for security fixes.
